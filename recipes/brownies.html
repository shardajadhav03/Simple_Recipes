        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch metal baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. Whisk in cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir in eggs, 1 at a time until incorporated. Add flour and stir until just combined. Scrape mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
